As to the tasks, remember that you are not supposed to know how to solve them right away. Rather, you are supposed to find solutions by discussing with peers, searching the web, or involving GenAI. That said, also recall that we never use GenAI without carefully inspecting generated codes **and** reading carefully the explanations of codes that are typically produced alongside generated codes.

    "So, as discussed in class, the evaluation of prediction performance is all about comparing model-based forecasts to actual outcomes. There are **two key ingredients** to make this work. First, we must define what we mean by *performance*. For this, we need suitable accuracy or error measures. Second, we must organize our data suitably to simulate a real-world application of a model. Before diving into each of these stages, let's revisit how we obtain predictions in the first place. This is where the `predict()` function of `sklearn` comes in handy."

    "Beyond splitting a data set into training and test set (aka the holdout method), we also introduced cross-validation, the process of partitioning a data set into *k* equally sized folds and repeatedly training a model on the combined data of k-1 folds and evaluating it on the left-out fold *k* times, such that each fold was used exactly once as the holdout or, synonymously , the *validation* fold. Relatively speaking, cross-validation is more reliable but also more costly than the simpler holdout method. It's costly because you have to train *k* models in total, which may cost a lot of time (e.g., when working with large data sets and/or complex ML algorithms). For the very same reason, cross-validation is also more reliable. You do not evaluate using one randomly sampled test set but carry out the evaluation *k* times.\n",

    "The coding demo was quite comprehensive. It is clearly time to give you a chance to try out your own coding skills. Prior to that, let's quickly note at least a few key findings from our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the test error varies a lot more than does the training error. This is less surprising when you remember how cross-validation works. The test set of each iteration contains roughly $\\frac{1}{k}$ of the data while the training set is much bigger, containing all $\\frac{k-1}{k}$ remaining data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, in this case, the median of the training and test set error distributions is roughly identical. This finding may look counterintuitive because we motivated cross-validation by saying that the performance on the training set is not a reliable estimate. While this statement is true, the results we observe are still plausible because we used linear regression. It is a characteristic of linear regression that training and test error deviate less than in other learning algorithms, as we will see in future sessions. "

    "### Exercise 3: \n",
    "Now that you saw the arguably most flexible and complex way to perform cross validation, your task is to simplify the above code using one of the other two options. This way, you will become familiar with all options and can make an informed choice next time you have to cross-validate a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We continue with focusing on the California Housing data and linear regression. Depending on your preferences, we propose **two flavors of the exercise**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 3.a (easier)\n",
    "Your task is to implement a 10-fold cross-validation of a regression model using the function `cross_val_score()`. More specifically:\n",
    "- Examine the function's documentation and make sure you understand its key arguments.\n",
    "- Write code to call the function such that it cross-validates a linear regression model for the California Housing data set\n",
    "- Perform ten fold cross-validation\n",
    "- Print the average performance of your model\n",
    "\n",
    "Should the above tasks have proved too easy we have a little extra task for you: ask yourself what specific error measure your code has considered. It is not so clear, right? \n",
    "\n",
    "<hr/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 3.b (harder)\n",
    "This version is similar to the above but involves the function `cross_validate()`, multiple error measures, and a more sophisticated way to visualize the results. Specifically, \n",
    "- Examine the function's documentation and make sure you understand its key arguments\n",
    "- Write code to call the function such that it cross-validates a linear regression model for the California Housing data set\n",
    "- Perform ten fold cross-validation\n",
    "- Your evaluation should comprise different error measures, namely, the MAE, the MSE, and the MAPE.\n",
    "- Visualize the performance of the regression model for each error measure using a box-plot\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Hint**: take a look into the [sklearn documentation on the scoring parameter](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#multimetric-scoring) to learn about ways of specifying error measures in a cross-validation process."

Specifically, it may be that the default cut-off was inappropriate and that we would see a better performance with a different cut-off. Entry **ROC-analysis**.\n",
